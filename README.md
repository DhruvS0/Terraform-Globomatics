## Getting Started

To get started with the Terraform-Globomatics project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhruvS0/Terraform-Globomatics.git
   ```
2. Install Terraform:  
   Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine. Refer to the official [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for installation instructions.

3. Configure Provider Credentials:  
   Set up the necessary provider credentials (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) in the respective provider configuration files. Refer to the provider-specific documentation for more details on configuring credentials.

4. Customize Configuration:  
   Modify the Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) as per your requirements. Update variables, resource definitions, and any other necessary configuration.

5. Initialize and Apply:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

For detailed instructions on deploying and managing the infrastructure stack, refer to the project's documentation or the README files present in each module or directory.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to work with the Terraform-Globomatics project:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html): Version X.X.X or higher.
- Provider Credentials: Make sure you have the necessary credentials configured for the cloud provider(s) you plan to use.

## Usage

The Terraform-Globomatics project provides a set of modules and configurations to deploy and manage various infrastructure resources. Each module or directory within the project may have its own specific usage instructions, so it's recommended to refer to the README file present in each module for detailed usage instructions.

Here's a general usage flow for deploying the infrastructure stack:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Configure the provider credentials for the cloud provider(s) you plan to use.
3. Customize the Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) as required.
4. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
5. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   Review the changes and confirm the deployment.

Remember to review and understand the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure before applying them. It's also recommended to follow infrastructure-as-code best practices, such as using version control and maintaining separate environments for different stages (e.g., development, staging, production).
